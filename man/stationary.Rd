\title{Stationary state probabilities}
\usage{
stationary(m, covs, beta = m$mle$beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Fitted model (as output by \code{\link{fitHMM}}).}

\item{covs}{Either a data frame or a design matrix of covariates.}

\item{beta}{Optional matrix of regression coefficients for the transition
probability model. By default, uses estimates in \code{m}.}
}
\value{
Matrix of stationary state probabilities. Each row corresponds to
a row of covs, and each column corresponds to a state.
}
\description{
Calculates the stationary probabilities of each state, for given
covariate values.
}
\examples{
# m is a moveHMM object (as returned by fitHMM), automatically loaded with the package
m <- example$m

# data frame of covariates
stationary(m, covs = data.frame(cov1 = 0, cov2 = 0))

# design matrix (each column corresponds to row of m$mle$beta)
stationary(m, covs = matrix(c(1, 0, cos(0)), 1, 3))
